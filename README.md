WELCOME

Right above this summary is a folder containing my presentation of a simple moving image of the London skyline.

I was able to achieve this by the help of the lecturers during the 2 great weeks at coding bootcamp, with my project being a mixture of lectures from Images, Variables and Objects & Classes. 
With those topics it allowed me to create the moving image with a code containing a backdrop of a London Skyline, as well as individual droplets of rain falling. 

If you look closely each droplet is different to one another with the use of 'map' helped create a realsitc imagery of rain, as the droplets further away will fall slowly and appear smaller while the droplets closer to the user/screen will fall faster and appear much larger in size.
